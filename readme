# CrisLink Control Plane (CLP v2)

CLP v2 is the Control & Status Plane for the CrisLink system.

It provides a unified view and control interface for:
- Lighthouses (CL-Nxx, CL-Oxx, CL-Mxx)
- Sensor nodes (CL-SNSxx)
- Hubs (CL-HUBxx)
- Buttons and gateways

CLP v2 is event-driven and technology-agnostic.
It does not care if nodes communicate over LoRaWAN, UART or IP.

## Core principles

- Nodes announce themselves automatically
- MQTT is the single integration layer
- CLP contains no node-specific logic
- All intelligence lives in the nodes
